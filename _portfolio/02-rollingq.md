## RollingQ: Reviving the Cooperation Dynamics in Multimodal Transformer

**Accepted to ICML 2025**

### Overview
This project investigates the cooperation dynamics between different modalities in multimodal transformers and proposes RollingQ, a novel approach to enhance cross-modal understanding and generation capabilities.

### Key Contributions
- Discovered that dynamic adaptability of widely-used self-attention models diminishes during training
- Identified a self-reinforcing cycle that progressively overemphasizes the favored modality
- Proposed Rolling Query (RollingQ) to balance attention allocation and restore cooperation dynamics
- Validated effectiveness across various multimodal scenarios
