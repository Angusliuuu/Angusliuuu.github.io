I'm maintaining a curated collection of recent research papers on **controllable generative models**!

## About This Collection

A continuously updated collection of **recent (2023–2025)** research papers on controllable generative models, with a special focus on both **UNet-based diffusion models** and **Transformer-based diffusion architectures**.

This list emphasizes core advances in:

* 🧭 **Control mechanisms** – including condition injection, adapters, multi-modal control
* 👁️ **Attention interpretation** – revealing what diffusion models focus on
* 🎛️ **Frequency-based control** – using spectral domain knowledge to guide generation
* 🔁 **Alignment & knowledge transfer** – enabling more coherent, faithful, and data-efficient synthesis
* 🧑‍🎨 **Image-to-image (I2I) editing** – flexible, structure-preserving transformation across domains

## Check it out!

👉 **GitHub Repository**: [Awesome-Controllable-Generative-Models-Papers](https://github.com/Angusliuuu/Awesome-Controllable-Generative-Models-Papers)

⭐ **36 stars** and growing!

The list covers major conferences (CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, etc.) and recent arXiv preprints. Perfect for researchers and developers exploring controllable synthesis.
