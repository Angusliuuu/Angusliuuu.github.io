I am currently an undergraduate student at the **Department of Artificial Intelligence, School of Informatics, Xiamen University**. My research focuses on multimodal learning, generative models, and visual understanding.

💡 I believe **clarity is the key to both research and coding**.

🚀 Research Interests
======
My current research interests include:

- 🎨 **Generative Models**: Diffusion Models, Unified Multimodal Understanding and Generation Models
- 🎓 **Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM)**: Exploring cross-modal fusion strategies and visual-language alignment
- 👁️ **Visual Backbone Networks**: Vision Transformers (ViT), CNNs, and Hybrid architectures

🧑‍💻 Currently Working On
======
- Exploring cross-modal fusion strategies for multimodal transformers
- Experimenting with visual-language alignment in diffusion-based generation
- Investigating cooperation dynamics in multimodal transformer architectures
