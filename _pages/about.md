## About Me

I am a third-year (Class of 2023) undergraduate student at the **Department of Artificial Intelligence, School of Informatics, Xiamen University**. 

📬 **Email**: [liuhang1@stu.xmu.edu.cn](mailto:liuhang1@stu.xmu.edu.cn)

I am fortunate to work as a research intern at the [MAC Lab (Key Laboratory of Multimedia Trusted Perception and Efficient Computing)](http://mac.xmu.edu.cn/), Xiamen University, under the supervision of Dr. [Jiayi Ji](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xp_rICcAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) (Postdoctoral Researcher) and Prof. [Rongrong Ji](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lRSD7PQAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). Previously, I worked as a research assistant with Prof. [Di Hu](https://dtaoo.github.io/) at the Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China.

My research focuses on **multimodal learning** and **generative models**, with a particular interest in exploring the fundamental relationship between **understanding and generation**. I am working towards developing **unified models** that bridge multimodal understanding and generation, investigating how these two capabilities can mutually enhance each other to achieve more general and robust multimodal intelligence.

**I am actively looking for Ph.D. or Master's opportunities starting Fall 2027.**

💡 *I believe clarity is the key to both research and coding.*

## Research Interests

My research interests lie at the intersection of multimodal perception and generation:

- **Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)**: Exploring efficient architectures and training strategies for cross-modal understanding and reasoning
- **Generative Models**: Developing unified frameworks for multimodal content generation, including diffusion models and autoregressive approaches
- **Unified Multimodal Understanding & Generation**: Building systems that can seamlessly perceive, understand, and generate content across vision, language, and audio modalities
