## About Me

I am currently an undergraduate student at the **Department of Artificial Intelligence, School of Informatics, Xiamen University**. 

I am fortunate to work as a research intern at the [MAC Lab (Key Laboratory of Multimedia Trusted Perception and Efficient Computing)](http://mac.xmu.edu.cn/), Xiamen University, under the supervision of Dr. [Jiayi Ji](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xp_rICcAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) (Postdoctoral Researcher) and Prof. [Rongrong Ji](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lRSD7PQAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). Previously, I worked as a research assistant with Prof. [Di Hu](https://dtaoo.github.io/) at the Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China.

My research focuses on **multimodal learning** and **generative models**, with the goal of building unified systems that can seamlessly understand and generate across multiple modalities.

💡 *I believe clarity is the key to both research and coding.*

## Research Interests

My research interests lie at the intersection of multimodal perception and generation:

- **Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)**: Exploring efficient architectures and training strategies for cross-modal understanding and reasoning
- **Generative Models**: Developing unified frameworks for multimodal content generation, including diffusion models and autoregressive approaches
- **Unified Multimodal Understanding & Generation**: Building systems that can seamlessly perceive, understand, and generate content across vision, language, and audio modalities

## Recent Work

Currently, I am working on:
- Investigating cooperation dynamics and interaction mechanisms in multimodal transformers
- Developing efficient cross-modal fusion strategies for large-scale multimodal models
- Exploring visual-language alignment in unified generation frameworks
